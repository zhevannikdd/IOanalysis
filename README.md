Methods of Input-Output analysis
These code for my diploma " The Impact of Structural Shocks on Aggregate Fluctuations in the Input-Output Model"
I use numpy, sklearn, pandas for Input-Output analysis. If you want to use this code, you should download Eora26 database and make new folder "data" and download matrix T and matrix FD.
